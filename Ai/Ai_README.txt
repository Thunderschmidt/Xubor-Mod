Almost all of these ai profiles have been tested heavily by me personally, HOWEVER because of TA's ai's unpredictable nature -- even though I told my ai to do smart things it may be stupid anyway, at least occassionally.

Tools Used: HPI viewer to view OTA files in maps to read the aiprofile=???; line to find what ai profile THAT map uses
and also HPI viewer to view/extract Ai profiles from the Ai dir
WordPad is my Ai Profile editor, which serves my purpose well enough and is much better than NotePad.

Additional Information: Further information about the ai can be found in SWI_AI_FAQ.txt!

MANY Cavedog (and TAMEC) maps do not use the best ai profile and may require renaming the appropriate ai profile to the name of the ai profile the map DOES use to get better results. Hundred Isles is probably the best example -- instead of using SeaBattle ai, it uses Default -- a LAND-only map ai, so the ai tries to flash rush and can't!

Read Ais_by_Map.txt for details about what ai profiles Cavedog maps use.
