Here's a list of what AI is used by all of the TACC maps *AND* downloadable maps, pulled from the OTA files. For third-party maps, you'll have to check the "aiprofile=;" line in the OTA file to be sure.

Don't bother with Urban maps;  the AI will never play very well on those, IMO.

In the REV31.GP3 patch, there are extra ai profiles that are not used on any of the maps in the original game. (but perhaps they should!) These are:
ACID (*ONLY* used in Core Contingency!)
HOVER (*ONLY* used in Core Contingency!)
METAL (*ONLY* used in Core Contingency!)
URBAN (*ONLY* used in Core Contingency!)
WATERWRLD (*ONLY* used in Core Contingency!)

As you can see from my many suggestions in parenthesis, many of the maps need different and possibly more specialized ai profiles -- like a partial-water map that has very weak tides but strong winds.

ACID
Acid Foursome (should use Default)
Acid Trip
Checker Ponds (should use Default)

Primary factors in choosing an ai for a map:

1.type of terrain: acid/waterworld/island/continent/land
2.how much metal: low metal/nonmetal/metal (2 or fewer metal spots per screen = low metal)
3.restrictive (mountains, trees, acid, lava)/open for free movement of ground units
4.wind levels: wind/solar (wind = 3000 or higher avg windspeed) = wind/solar map?
5.map size: <8 x 8 map/12 x 12 map/>20 x 20 map (small, medium, large map)
6.unit max: <150 unit max/250 unit max/400+ unit max (small, medium, large unit max)

1.Acid/Continent/Island/Land/laVa/Waterworld
2.Low/Nonmetal/Metal
3.Restrictive/Open
4.Low/Windy
5.Tiny/Small/Medium/Large/Huge
6.Small/Medium/Large unit max

		1	2	3	4	5	6	Good Example map:
Nasty water/restrictive movement:
ACID		A	N	R	L	*	*	Acid Trip
HOVER		?	N	R	L	?	*	The Bayou
??????	C	M	R	L	*	*	Over Crude Water
??????	*	N	R	L	*	*	Temblorian Mist

Scare land water maps:
WATERWRLD	W	L	R	L	*	*	Brain Coral
SEABATTLE	I	N	R	L	*	*	Hundred Isles

Big island water maps:
URBAN		C	L	R	L	*	*	Town & Country
HOVER		C	N	R	L	L	*	Two Continents
SEAMETAL	C	M	R	L	*	*	Metal Isles, Seven Islands

Mostly land, but too much water to ignore map:
KROGOTH	C	M	O	L	L	L	Krogoth Encounter
HOVER?	I/C	N	O	L	*	*	Ring Atoll

Land maps:
DEFAULT	L	N	O	L	*	*	The Great Divide
METAL		L	M	O	L	*	*	Metal Heck

Windy land maps:
WIND		L	N	O	W	*	*	The Cold Place
WINDMET	L	M	O	W	*	*	Metal Heck 2

* means doesn't matter

The standard ai profiles:
(presumes)
ACID		= MOSTLY acid map, nonmetal, low winds, open terrain, medium map
AIRBATTLE	= continent map *OR* restrictive terrain, nonmetal, low winds, large map
DEFAULT	= land map, nonmetal, open terrain, low winds, medium map
HOVER		= continent map, nonmetal, open terrain, low winds, medium map
KROGOTH	= continent map, metal, open terrain, low winds, huge map, high unit max
METAL		= land map, metal, open terrain, low winds, medium map
SEABATTLE	= island map, nonmetal, open terrain, low winds, medium map
URBAN		= continent map, low metal, open terrain, low winds, large map
WATERWRLD	= waterworld map, low metal, open terrain, low winds, medium map

My special ai profiles:
(presumes)
SEAMETAL	= continent map, metal, open terrain, low winds, medium map
WIND		= land map, nonmetal, open terrain, high winds, medium map
WINDMET	= land map, metal, open terrain, high winds, medium map
HOVERWIN	= continent map, nonmetal, open terrain, high winds, medium map
